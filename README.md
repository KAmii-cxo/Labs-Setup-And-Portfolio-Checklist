# SOC Analyst Career Checklist

A structured checklist to help aspiring SOC Analysts build the necessary skills, experience, and portfolio for a successful career.

## 1. Threat Hunting Lab
- [ ] Set up multiple VMs (Windows/Linux) as endpoints.  
- [ ] Install and configure EDR tools: Carbon Black, CrowdStrike, Cortex XDR.  
- [ ] Simulate malicious activity (e.g., using known malware samples).  
- [ ] Develop a threat hunting hypothesis (e.g., investigate suspicious files).  
- [ ] Perform IOC-based threat hunting using Carbon Black.  
- [ ] Investigate alerts and analyze threats using CrowdStrike.  
- [ ] Use Cortex XDR for advanced detection and response.  
- [ ] Document findings (screenshots, detected threats, and analysis).  
- [ ] Create a detailed report for your portfolio.  

## 2. Malware Analysis Lab
- [ ] Set up an isolated VM with a snapshot feature.  
- [ ] Install tools like PE-bear, REMnux, and optionally Cuckoo Sandbox.  
- [ ] Download benign malware samples for analysis in a safe environment.  
- [ ] Perform static analysis (check file structure, imports, metadata).  
- [ ] Perform dynamic analysis (monitor runtime behavior, registry changes).  
- [ ] Optionally, use Cuckoo Sandbox for automated analysis.  
- [ ] Capture IOCs (IP addresses, domains, hashes).  
- [ ] Document TTPs, findings, and mitigation strategies in a report.  

## 3. SIEM Lab
- [ ] Set up a VM with Splunk or ELK Stack.  
- [ ] Configure log collection (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon).  
- [ ] Ingest security-related logs into the SIEM tool.  
- [ ] Write search queries to detect threats (e.g., failed logins, escalation attempts).  
- [ ] Develop dashboards for data visualization.  
- [ ] Configure alerts for potential threats (e.g., brute-force attempts).  
- [ ] Document alerts, queries, and findings in a report.  

## 4. Network Traffic Analysis Lab
- [ ] Set up multiple VMs simulating a network environment.  
- [ ] Install Wireshark and tcpdump for traffic analysis.  
- [ ] Capture network traffic using Wireshark (analyze anomalies, DDoS patterns).  
- [ ] Use tcpdump for command-line packet analysis.  
- [ ] Document traffic patterns, findings, and insights in a report.  

## 5. Threat Intelligence Lab
- [ ] Set up MISP for threat intelligence sharing.  
- [ ] Integrate VirusTotal, Maltego, and Shodan for additional research.  
- [ ] Analyze malware samples on VirusTotal.  
- [ ] Investigate IOCs using OSINT tools (domains, hashes, IPs).  
- [ ] Share intelligence on MISP and document results.  
- [ ] Write a threat intelligence report with defense recommendations.  

## 6. Penetration Testing Lab
- [ ] Deploy vulnerable environments (Metasploitable, OWASP Juice Shop).  
- [ ] Use Kali Linux for penetration testing.  
- [ ] Scan vulnerabilities using Nmap.  
- [ ] Exploit systems using Metasploit or other tools.  
- [ ] Practice web vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS) with OWASP ZAP.  
- [ ] Document vulnerabilities, exploitation steps, and mitigation strategies.  

## 7. Security Automation & Orchestration Lab
- [ ] Set up security tools like TheHive and Cortex.  
- [ ] Create incident response playbooks in TheHive.  
- [ ] Automate actions (e.g., blocking IPs, disabling accounts) with Cortex.  
- [ ] Test automated workflows and monitor their effectiveness.  
- [ ] Document the setup, playbooks, and automation results.  

## 8. Security Control & Configuration Management Lab
- [ ] Harden Windows/Linux systems (disable unnecessary services, secure permissions).  
- [ ] Configure firewall rules to restrict unauthorized access.  
- [ ] Implement IDS/IPS tools like Snort or Suricata.  
- [ ] Test and monitor the effectiveness of security controls.  
- [ ] Write a report detailing configuration changes and security improvements.  

## 9. Documentation & Reporting
- [ ] Capture detailed screenshots of each lab process.  
- [ ] Write concise, clear reports for each lab, including:
  - Objectives
  - Setup steps
  - Tools used
  - Findings and recommendations  
- [ ] Organize reports into case studies for a professional portfolio.  
- [ ] Create a GitHub repository or portfolio website to showcase your work.  

## 10. Continuous Learning
- [ ] Stay updated on new tools, techniques, and vulnerabilities.  
- [ ] Subscribe to cybersecurity blogs, podcasts, and threat feeds.  
- [ ] Experiment with emerging cybersecurity tools in your lab.  
- [ ] Regularly update your portfolio with new labs and findings.
